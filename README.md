<h2>Wireless LED controller</h2> 

An LED controller for addressable led strips compatible with WS2812B.

 * The led strip is controlled via an Android app
 * The app uses a bluetooth connection to send commands to the led controller.
 * The app provides a list of effects and commands that can be selected to display on the leds.
 * Also it is possible to create custom effects to display from the app.
 
 Android apk: <a>https://github.com/dobrovv/LED_Controller/blob/master/Android/app/app-release.apk</a>
 
 
 I am using a BLUNO Beetle BLE board, to connect receiver to Android and drive the led strip.
