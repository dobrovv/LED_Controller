#LED_Controller

This is an App designed to Control RGB-Led Strips via Network (Wifi).
It sends Commands to a configurable IP-Address connected to a Raspberry Pi.
The Raspberry runs a [Python-Server-Script](https://github.com/simondankelmann/LED-Server) listening for Commands,
at this moment it only waits for RGB values to set the chosen color and a few effects but there will be some more options soon ;)

The Colorpicker-Plugin (HoloColorPicker) can be found here:
